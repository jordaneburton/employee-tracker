# Employee-Tracker
A command-line application to manage an employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL

## Description

The Employee Tracker is an application that allows you to store information on the departments, roles, and employees of your company. The application is powered by the Inquirer and MySQL node packages and allows you to interact with the SQL server through the inquirer prompting interface. After choosing an option, you may be prompted to enter further information on the ID's of different departments or roles, etc. Once you have input valid responses into all of the prompts, you will be presented with the desired information in the terminal, as well as another inquirer prompt if you would like to continue to search through the database.
